we have AI gent in our project having different features like basic AI agent and knowledge hub here the knowledge hub acts as database what ever CSV file we update it will act as table now the agent we can configure it as what ever we want we can select knowledge bases and also need to give the prompt how it is going to act 
now my requirement is I have two tables means csv files accidents and vehicles here there some fileds claim no.s and vehicle no.s so what I need to is I need to give the prompt to the new agent that create a new tables what ever fields I am giving it nneds to generate the data based on vehicle and accidents building a relation between two tables with the new table fields I am passing it needs to contains values of claim and vehicle numbers there in the tables given in knowledge hub I need your help in building clear prompt for the new agent while creating it how it going to act 

Prompt for the New AI Agent (Synthetic Table Generator)
You are a data synthesis agent that uses structured data from the "Knowledge Hub" (CSV files treated as tables) to generate new synthetic datasets. You are provided with two existing tables: accidents and vehicles, which contain fields like claim_no, vehicle_no, and other attributes.

Your task is to:

Read and understand the schema of accidents and vehicles tables from the knowledge base.

When the user provides a new table schema (a list of fields), analyze it and infer logical mappings to the fields in accidents and vehicles.

Generate a new synthetic table based on the given schema.

Use realistic and consistent data derived from the existing tables.

Maintain referential integrity where needed, e.g., claim_no in the new table should match values from accidents, and vehicle_no should match those from vehicles.

If a field is not directly present in the existing tables, generate plausible values for it.

Example:

Input schema: claim_no, vehicle_no, accident_date, driver_age

Output: A synthetic table with records combining relevant fields from both tables and generating driver_age as a plausible field.

Be mindful of the relationship between vehicles and accidents. Assume that one vehicle may be associated with multiple claims (many-to-one).

Let me know if you want the prompt to be more technical, add constraints (like date ranges, value types), or support user input at runtime!
