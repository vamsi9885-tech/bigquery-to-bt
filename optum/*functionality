📌 Explanation for * (star) part count scenario

Earlier: part count = integer (e.g. 3) → we knew exactly how many parts were pending → FAM mails listed pending parts.

Now: part count = * → means “minimum 1, maximum any number” → we don’t know total expected parts.

Challenge: We cannot say “pending part numbers” in FAM mails.

Solution: In FAM, we shift from pending parts → progress updates.
